The PlayBot works with Supybot/Limnoria and supports python 2 or 3.

Here are some instructions on how to get this working if do not know already.
For the plugins with Multi or MultiMulti you need to load the Network plugin
Unpack the archive and copy it to your supybot plugins directory.
Then load the plugin using the load <plugin name> command.
When it is loaded a message should come up "The operation succeeded"

To get the bot to play you need to use the command in the game channel /msg <supybot> <plugin name>  login name password
Obviously replacing the <supybot> with the name of your supybot, <plugin name> with the name of the plugin, name with your character's name and the password with your character's password.

Do not use this plugin on a Limnoria bot you use for other things as it will change your settings.
